*REACT*

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces (UIs) in a
declarative and component-based manner. It was developed by Facebook and is
widely used for building dynamic and interactive web applications.

In conjuction with Angular and Vue, is one of the most common front-end frameworks
nowadays

**Why React?**

- It is used to create SPA applications.
- React has no opinions about what technology we use with it; we can choose the
  libraries we use for HTTP requests, front-end routing, styling, etc.
- React does not prevent us from using the built-in DOM manipulation in JavaScript.
- React is highly popular (it has more weekly downloads on NPM than Angular or Vue).

** MPA (Multi-Page Application) vs SPA (Single-Page Application)

MPA (Multi-Page Application) is an architecture with separate HTML pages for
different views, each generated by the server. Navigation triggers server
requests and page reloads. It offers better initial loading speed and traditional
server-centric rendering.

SPA (Single-Page Application) loads a single HTML page initially and uses JavaScript
to dynamically update content without full page reloads. It handles navigation
on the client-side, relies on APIs, and provides an interactive and responsive
user experience. SPAs minimize server round trips and enable real-time updates
within a single page context.
